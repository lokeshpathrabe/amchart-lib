# amChartLib

This repo includes an helper library to create amcharts chart and maps with easy steps and a demo app to illustrate charts/maps. I have tried to abstract the common configuration which do not need to be changed while exposing needed configuration. This could make seting up charts/maps easy with less lines of code.

/src/demo is the demo app and everything in /src/lib is the helper library. To start using this just clone the repo and run ```npm install``` followed by ```npm start```. The project installs a "nwb": "0.23.x" boiler plate code and will start a local server on localhost:3000.
